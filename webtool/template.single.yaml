      Please confirm your finding for the second time. Output all your message in
      this format "<output>your finding</output><thought>your thought</thought>".


      If you confirm your finding, keep the content of <output> tag as the same as
      you last did.


      If your last finding is wrong, just output "[]" in <output> tag.


      IMPORTANT:

      - nothing should be output outside <output> and <thought> tag.
    output: |-
      输出格式如下：
      Output all your message in this format "<output>your
      finding</output><thought>your thought</thought>"

      Output your finding into <output></output> tag in the following JSON format:
      ```json
      [
        {
          "title": "summary your finding, less than 30 words, in Chinese, no QUOTES and backslashes symbol here",

          "filepath": "filepath @ line number range, no QUOTES and backslashes symbol here"
        },
        // other findings...
      ]
      ```
      In field content, you must explain why it is incorrect, provide evidence. must
      display code snippets in markdown code block. must tell how to improve. This
      part should be as much detail as possible, provide evidence to support your
      conclusion. 

      VERY IMPORTANT: 
      - you mush make sure the JSON output is a valid JSON. 
      - Be careful about each field in the JSON output. QUOTES and backslashes and
      newline always make errors. 
      - Make sure you escape these symbols in JSON value field.
      - No need to escape newline symbol outside JSON data!
